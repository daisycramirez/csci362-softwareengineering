For this project, my role is to maintain and create the technical documentation. 
This includes documents such as the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), design documents, and user manuals. 
I will be expected to ensure clarity and consistency throughout all documentation.
I also intend to organize the workflow to allow the work to be efficient. 
Lastly, I will contribute to the testing process by identifing errors.
